# RELEASE NOTES

14 Mar 2016 - Apache Mynewt V0.8 Beta 2 

For full release notes, please visit the 
[Apache Mynewt Wiki](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/MYNEWT/Release+Notes).
For information about bugs fixed in beta 2, please view the 
[Issue Tracker Summary](https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/ReleaseNote.jspa?projectId=12319221&version=12334805)

This is the second source release of Apache Mynewt Core.  For more 
information on Apache Mynewt, please visit the 
[Apache Mynewt Website](https://mynewt.apache.org/).  

As an early beta release of Apache Mynewt, all the normal caveats apply:

  * APIs and commands may change

  * There are definitely bugs hiding around many corners

However, we believe this release of Apache Mynewt represents the going forward 
architecture and layout of the Apache Mynewt Operating System.  Further, we have 
been running Apache Mynewt stably on real hardware for over 6+ mos, without 
any issues.  So, people who are interested in playing around, and trying Mynewt,
are encouraged to download and begin to evaluate it.

A full roadmap for Apache Mynewt is available on the [website](http://mynewt.apache.org/about/).
In addition, a detailed view of what is being worked on, and all open feature 
requests are in 
[JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MYNEWT/?selectedTab=com.atlassian.jira.jira-projects-plugin:roadmap-panel).

More information is available in the [README](/README.md) file in this directory.

The next release of Apache Mynewt is scheduled for April 22nd, 2016.  If building 
an Operating System for Microcontrollers sounds fun to you, get in touch by sending
a mail to the [Apache Mynewt Developer's list](mailto:dev@mynewt.incubator.apache.org).
