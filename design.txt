*** SUMMARY

ffs (working title) is a flash file system with the following priorities:
    * Minimal RAM usage
    * Reliability


*** DISK STRUCTURE

At the top level, an ffs disk is partitioned into areas.  An area is a region
of disk with the following properties:
    (1) An area can be fully erased without affecting any other areas.
    (2) A write to one area does not restrict writes to other areas.

Clarification of point (2): some flash hardware divides its memory space into
"blocks."  Writes within a block must be sequential, but writes to one block
have no effect on what parts of other blocks can be written.  Thus, for flash
hardware with such a restriction, each area must comprise a discrete number of
blocks.

While not strictly necessary, it is recommended that all areas have the same
size.

On disk, each area is prefixed with the following header:

/** On-disk representation of an area header. */
struct ffs_disk_area {
    uint32_t fda_magic[4];  /* FFS_AREA_MAGIC{0,1,2,3} */
    uint32_t fda_length;    /* Total size of area, in bytes (includes hdr). */
    uint8_t fda_ver;        /* Current ffs version: 0 */
    uint8_t fda_gc_seq;     /* Garbage collection count. */
    uint8_t reserved8;
    uint8_t fda_id;         /* 0xff if scratch area. */
};

Beyond its header, an area contains a sequence of disk objects, representing
the contents of the file system.  There are two types of objects: inodes and
data blocks.  An inode represents a file or directory; a data block represents
part of a file's contents.

/** On-disk representation of an inode (file or directory). */
struct ffs_disk_inode {
    uint32_t fdi_magic;         /* FFS_INODE_MAGIC */
    uint32_t fdi_id;            /* Unique object ID. */
    uint32_t fdi_seq;           /* Sequence number; greater supersedes
                                   lesser. */
    uint32_t fdi_parent_id;     /* Object ID of parent directory inode. */
    uint8_t reserved8;
    uint8_t fdi_filename_len;   /* Length of filename, in bytes. */
    uint16_t fdi_crc16;         /* Covers rest of header and filename. */
    /* Followed by filename. */
};

An inode filename's length cannot exceed 256 bytes.  The filename is not
null-terminated.  The following ASCII characters are not allowed in a filename:
    * /  (slash character)
    * \0 (NUL character)

/** On-disk representation of a data block. */
struct ffs_disk_block {
    uint32_t fdb_magic;     /* FFS_BLOCK_MAGIC */
    uint32_t fdb_id;        /* Unique object ID. */
    uint32_t fdb_seq;       /* Sequence number; greater supersedes lesser. */
    uint32_t fdb_inode_id;  /* Object ID of owning inode. */
    uint32_t fdb_prev_id;   /* Object ID of previous block in file;
                               FFS_ID_NONE if this is the first block. */
    uint16_t fdb_data_len;  /* Length of data contents, in bytes. */
    uint16_t fdb_crc16;     /* Covers rest of header and data. */
    /* Followed by 'fdb_data_len' bytes of data. */
};

Each data block contains the ID of the previous data block in the file.
Together, the set of blocks in a file form a reverse singly-linked list.

The maximum number of data bytes that a block can contain is determined at
initialization-time.  The result is the greatest number which satisfies all of
the following restrictions:
    o No more than 2048.
    o At least two maximum-sized blocks can fit in the smallest area.

The 2048 number was chosen somewhat arbitrarily, and may change in the future.


*** ID SPACE

All disk objects have a unique 32-bit ID.  The ID space is partitioned as
follows:
      * 0x00000000 - 0x0fffffff: Directory inodes.
      * 0x10000000 - 0x7fffffff: File inodes.
      * 0x80000000 - 0xfffffffe: Data blocks.
      * 0xffffffff             : Reserved (FFS_ID_NONE)


*** SCRATCH AREA

A valid ffs file system must contain a single "scratch area."  The scratch area
does not contain any objects of its own, and is only used during garbage
collection.  The scratch area must have a size greater than or equal to each of
the other areas in flash.  


*** RAM REPRESENTATION

The file system comprises a set of objects of the following two types:
    1) inode
    2) data block

Every object in the file system is stored in a hash table (size is
configurable; default is 256 slots).  An object's hash key is derived from its
32-bit ID.  All objects are represented by the following structure:

struct ffs_hash_entry {
    SLIST_ENTRY(ffs_hash_entry) fhe_next;
    uint32_t fhe_id;        /* 0 - 0x7fffffff if inode; else if block. */
    uint32_t fhe_flash_loc; /* Upper-byte = area idx; rest = area offset. */
};

For each data block, the above structure is all that is stored in RAM.  To
acquire more information about a data block, the block header must be read from
flash.

Inodes require a fuller RAM representation to capture the structure of the file
system.  There are two types of inodes: files and directories.  Each inode hash
entry is actually an instance of the following structure:

struct ffs_inode_entry {
    struct ffs_hash_entry fie_hash_entry;
    SLIST_ENTRY(ffs_inode) fie_sibling_next;
    union {
        struct ffs_inode_list fie_child_list;   /* If directory. */
        struct ffs_hash_entry *fie_last_block;  /* If file. */
    };
    uint8_t fie_refcnt;
    /* Three bytes of padding! */
};

A directory inode contains a list of its child files and directories
(fie_child_list).  These entries are sorted alphabetically using the ASCII
character set.

File inodes contain a pointer to the last data block in the file
(fie_last_block).  For most file operations, the reversed block list must be
walked backwards.  This introduces a number of speed inefficiencies:
    * All data blocks must be read to determine the length of the file.
    * Data blocks often need to be processed sequentially.  The reversed nature
      of the block list transforms this from linear time to an O(n^2)
      operation.

Furthermore, obtaining information about any constituent data block requires a
separate flash read.


*** INODE CACHE AND DATA BLOCK CACHE
The speed issues are addressed by a pair of caches.  Cached inodes entries
contain the file length and a much more convenient doubly-linked list of cached
data blocks.  The benefit of using caches is that the size of the caches need
not be proportional to the size of the file system.  In other words, caches can
address speed efficiency concerns without negatively impacting the file
system's scalability.

The following data structures are used in the inode and data block caches.

/** Full data block representation; not stored permanently RAM. */
struct ffs_block {
    struct ffs_hash_entry *fb_hash_entry;   /* Points to actual block entry. */
    uint32_t fb_seq;                        /* Sequence number; greater
                                               supersedes lesser. */
    struct ffs_inode_entry *fb_inode_entry; /* Owning inode. */
    struct ffs_hash_entry *fb_prev;         /* Previous block in file. */
    uint16_t fb_data_len;                   /* # of data bytes in block. */
    uint16_t reserved16;
}

/** Represents a single cached data block. */
struct ffs_cache_block {
    TAILQ_ENTRY(ffs_cache_block) fcb_link; /* Next / prev cached block. */
    struct ffs_block fcb_block;            /* Full data block. */
    uint32_t fcb_file_offset;              /* File offset of this block. */
};

/** Full inode representation; not stored permanently RAM. */
struct ffs_inode {
    struct ffs_inode_entry *fi_inode_entry; /* Points to actual inode entry. */
    uint32_t fi_seq;                        /* Sequence number; greater
                                               supersedes lesser. */
    struct ffs_inode_entry *fi_parent;      /* Points to parent directory. */
    uint8_t fi_filename_len;                /* # chars in filename. */
    uint8_t fi_filename[FFS_SHORT_FILENAME_LEN]; /* First 3 bytes. */
};

/** Doubly-linked tail queue of cached blocks; contained in cached inodes. */
TAILQ_HEAD(ffs_block_cache_list, ffs_block_cache_entry);

/** Represents a single cached file inode. */
struct ffs_cache_inode {
    TAILQ_ENTRY(ffs_cache_inode) fci_link;       /* Sorted; LRU at tail. */
    struct ffs_inode fci_inode;                  /* Full inode. */
    struct ffs_cache_block_list fci_block_list;  /* List of cached blocks. */
    uint32_t fci_file_len;                       /* Total file size. */
};

Only file inodes are cached; directory inodes are never cached.

Within a cached inode, all cached data blocks for contiguous.  E.g., if the
start and end of a file are cached, then the middle must also be cached.  A
data block is only cached if its owning file is also cached.

Internally, cached inodes are stored in a singly-linked list, ordered by time
of use.  The most-recently-used entry is the first element in the list.  If a
new inode needs to be cached, but the inode cache is full, the
least-recently-used entry is freed to make room for the new one.  The following operations cause an inode to be cached:
    * Querying a file's length.
    * Seeking within a file.
    * Reading from a file.
    * Writing to a file.

The following operations cause a data block to be cached:
    * Reading from the block.
    * Writing to the block.

If one of the above operations is applied to a data block that is not currently cached, ffs uses the following procedure to cache the necessary blocks:
    1. If none of the owning inode's blocks are currently cached, allocate a
       cached block entry and insert it into the inode's list.
    2. Else if the requested file offset is less than that of the first cached
       block, bridge the gap between the inode's sequence of cached blocks and
       the block that now needs to be cached.  This is accomplished by caching
       each block in the gap, finishing with the requested block.
    3. Else (the requested offset is beyond the end of the cache),
        a. If the requested offset belongs to the block that immediately
           follows the end of the cache, cache the block and append it to the
           list.
        b. Else, clear the cache, and populate it with the single entry
           corresponding to the requested block.

If the system is unable to allocate a cached block entry at any point during
the above procedure, the system frees up other blocks currently in the cache.
This is accomplished as follows:
    1. Iterate the inode cache in reverse (i.e., start with the
       least-recently-used entry).  For each entry:
        a. If the entry's cached block list is empty, advance to the next
           entry.
        b. Else, free all the cached blocks in the entry's list.

Because the system imposes a minimum block cache size of one, the above
procedure will always reclaim at least one cache block entry.  The above
procedure may result in the freeing of the block list that belongs to the very
inode being operated on.  This is OK, as the final block to get cached is
always the block being requested.

*** FILENAME CACHE
It may also be necessary to speed up filename lookups with a second cache.
Details TBD.


*** CONFIGURATION
The file system is configured by populating fields in a global structure.  Each
field in the structure corresponds to a setting.  All configuration must be
done prior to calling ffs_init().  The configuration structure is defined as
follows:

struct ffs_config {
    /** Number of hash table slots; default=256. */
    uint32_t fc_hash_size;

    /** Maximum number of inodes; default=1024. */
    uint32_t fc_num_inodes;

    /** Maximum number of data blocks; default=4096. */
    uint32_t fc_num_blocks;

    /** Maximum number of open files; default=4. */
    uint32_t fc_num_files;

    /** Inode cache size; default=4. */
    uint32_t fc_num_cache_inodes;

    /** Data block cache size; default=64. */
    uint32_t fc_num_cache_blocks;
};

extern struct ffs_config ffs_config;

Any fields that are set to 0 (or not set at all) inherit the corresponding
default value.


*** INITIALIZATION

There are two means of initializing an ffs file system:
    (1) Restore an existing file system via detection.
    (2) Create a new file system via formatting.

Both methods require the user to describe how the flash memory is divided into
areas.  This is accomplished with an array of struct ffs_area_desc, defined as
follows:

struct ffs_area_desc {
    uint32_t fad_offset;    /* Flash offset of start of area. */
    uint32_t fad_length;    /* Size of area, in bytes. */
};

An array of area descriptors is terminated by an entry with a fad_length field
of 0.

The expected initialization sequence is as follows:

    (1) Detect an ffs file system anywhere in flash.
    (2) If no file system detected, format a new file system in a specific
        region of flash.


*** DETECTION

The file system detection process consists of scanning a specified set of
flash regions for valid ffs areas, and populating the RAM representation of
the file system with the detected objects.  Detection is initiated with the
following function:

/**
 * Searches for a valid ffs file system among the specified areas.  This
 * function succeeds if a file system is detected among any subset of the
 * supplied areas.  If the area set does not contain a valid file system,
 * a new one can be created via a separate call to ffs_format().
 *
 * @param area_descs        The area set to search.  This array must be
 *                              terminated with a 0-length area.
 *
 * @return                  0 on success;
 *                          FFS_ECORRUPT if no valid file system was detected;
 *                          other nonzero on error.
 */
int ffs_detect(const struct ffs_area_desc *area_descs);

As indicated, not every area descriptor needs to reference a valid ffs area.
Detection is successful as long as a complete file system is detected
somewhere in the specified regions of flash.  If an application is unsure
where a file system might be located, it is expected that the application
would initiate detection across the entire flash region.

A detected file system is valid if:
    (1) At least one non-scratch area is present.
    (2) At least one scratch area is present (only the first gets used if
        there is more than one).
    (3) The root directory inode is present.

During detection, each indicated region of flash is checked for a valid area
header.  The contents of each valid non-scratch area are then restored into the
ffs RAM representation.  The following procedure is applied to each object in
the area:

    (1) Convert the disk object into its corresponding RAM representation and
        insert it into the hash table.  If the object is an inode:
            o Its crc16 is verified; if invalid, the object is discarded.
            o Its reference count is initialized to 1, indicating ownership by
              its parent directory.

    (2) If an object with the same ID is already present, then one supersedes
        the other.  Accept the object with the greater sequence number and
        discard the other.

    (3) If the object references a nonexistant inode (parent directory in the
        case of an inode; owning file in the case of a data block), insert a
        temporary "dummy" inode into the hash table so that inter-object links
        can be maintained until the absent inode is eventually restored.  Dummy
        inodes are identified by a reference count of 0.

    (4) If a delete record for an inode is encountered, the inode is marked as
        a dummy.

Note: in the above procedure, a crc check is applied to inodes, but not to data
blocks.  The data block crc check is delayed until the sweep phase, described
below.

After all areas have been restored, a sweep is performed across the entire RAM
representation so that invalid inodes can be deleted from memory.  For each
inode:
    * If its reference count is 0, delete it from the RAM representation.
    * Else, perform a crc verification on each of its constituent data blocks.
      If any block fails this check, delete the inode from the RAM
      representation.

When an inode is deleted during this sweep, all dependent objects are also
deleted.  In the case of a directory, these are children inodes; in the case of
a file, these are constituent data blocks.  Note: These deletions occur only in
RAM; nothing gets written to flash at this time.

In addition, a single scratch area is identified during the detection process.
The first area whose 'fda_id' value is set to 0xff is designated as the file
system scratch area.  If no valid scratch area is found, the cause could be
that the system was restarted while a garbage collection cycle was in progress.
Such a condition is identified by the presence of two areas with the same ID.
In such a case, the shorter of the two areas is erased and designated as the
scratch area.


*** FORMATTING

A new file system is created via formatting.  Formatting is achieved via the
following function:

/**
 * Erases all the specified areas and initializes them with a clean ffs
 * file system.
 *
 * @param area_descs        The set of areas to format.
 *
 * @return                  0 on success;
 *                          nonzero on failure.
 */
int ffs_format(const struct ffs_area_desc *area_descs);

On success, an area header is written to each of the specified locations.  The
largest area in the set is designated as the initial scratch area.


*** FLASH WRITES

The ffs implementation always writes in a strictly sequential fashion within an
area.  For each area, the system keeps track of the current offset.  Whenever
an object gets written to an area, it gets written to that area's current
offset, and the offset is increased by the object's disk size.

When a write needs to be performed, the ffs implementation selects the
appropriate destination area by iterating though each area until one with
sufficient free space is encountered.

There is no write buffering.  Each call to a write function results in a write
operation being sent to the flash hardware.


*** NEW OBJECTS

Whenever a new object is written to disk, it is assigned the following
properties:
    * ID: A unique value is selected from the 32-bit ID space, as appropriate
      for the object's type.
    * Sequence number: 0

When a new file or directory is created, a corresponding inode is written to
flash.  Likewise, a new data block also results in the writing of a
corresponding disk object.


*** MOVING / RENAMING FILES AND DIRECTORIES

When a file or directory is moved or renamed, its corresponding inode is
rewritten to flash with the following properties:
    * ID: Unchanged
    * Sequence number: Previous value plus one.
    * Parent inode: As specified by the move / rename operation.
    * Filename: As specified by the move / rename operation.

Because the inode's ID is unchanged, all dependent objects remain valid.


*** UNLINKING FILES AND DIRECTORIES

When a file or directory is unlinked from its parent directory, a deletion
record for the unlinked inode gets written to flash.  The deletion record is an
inode with the following properties:
    * ID: Unchanged
    * Sequence number: Previous value plus one.
    * Parent inode ID: FFS_ID_NONE

If the unlinked inode is a directory, then all the directory's children inodes
are recursively unlinked as well.  This is implemented using non-recursive
breadth-first traversal is used to prevent stack overflow due to recursion.

When a file inode is unlinked, no deletion records need to be written for the
file's constituent data blocks.  During the next file system detection, it is
recognized that the data blocks belong to a deleted file, so they are not
restored into the RAM representation.

If a file has an open handle at the time it gets unlinked, application code
can continued to use the file handle to read and write data.  All files retain
a reference count, and a file isn't deleted from the RAM representation until
its reference code drops to 0.  Any attempt to open an unlinked file fail,
even if the file is referenced by other file handles.


*** WRITING TO A FILE

The following procedure is used whenever the application code writes to a file.
First, if the write operation specifies too much data to fit into a single
block, the operation is split into several separate write operations.  Then,
for each write operation:

    (1) Determine which existing blocks the write operation overlaps
        (n = number of overwritten blocks).

    (2) If n = 0, this is an append operation.  Write a data block with the
        following properties:
            * ID: New unique value.
            * Sequence number: 0.

    (3) Else (n > 1), this write overlaps existing data.
            (a) For each block in [1, 2, ... n-1], write a new block
                containing the updated contents.  Each new block supersedes the
                block it overwrites.  That is, each block has the following
                properties:
                    * ID: Unchanged
                    * Sequence number: Previous value plus one.

            (b) Write the nth block.  The nth block includes any additional
                data which does not overlap any existing blocks (i.e., appended
                data).  As with the other blocks, its ID is unchanged and its
                sequence number is incremented.

Appended data can only be written to the end of the file.  That is, "holes" are
not supported.

In the case of overlap, non-overlapped portions of blocks are written alongside
the new data in the blocks.


*** GARBAGE COLLECTION

When the file system is too full to accomodate a write operation, the system
must perform garbage collection to make room.  The garbage collection
procedure is described below:

    (1) The non-scratch area with the lowest garbage collection sequence
        number is selected as the "source area."  If there are other areas
        with the same sequence number, the one with the smallest flash offset
        is selected. 

    (2) The source area's ID is written to the scratch area's header,
        transforming it into a non-scratch ID.  The former scratch area is now
        known as the "destination area."

    (3) The RAM representation is exhaustively searched for collectible
        objects.  The following procedure is applied to each inode in the
        system:

        (a) If the inode is resident in the source area, copy the inode record
            to the destination area.

        (b) If the inode is a file inode, walk the inode's list of data blocks,
            starting with the last block in the file.  Each block that is
            resident in the source area is copied to the destination area.  If
            there is a run of two or more blocks that are resident in the
            source area, they are consolidated and copied to the destination
            area as a single new block.

    (4) The source area is reformatted as a scratch sector (i.e., is is fully
        erased, and its header is rewritten with an ID of 0xff).  The area's
        garbage collection sequence number is incremented prior to rewriting
        the header.  This area is now the new scratch sector.


*** MISC

    * RAM usage:
        o 24 bytes per inode
        o 12 bytes per data block
        o 36 bytes per inode cache entry
        o 32 bytes per data block cache entry
    * Maximum filename size: 256 characters
    * Disallowed filename characters: '/' and '\0'


*** ISSUES

    * No solution when the 32-bit ID space is exhausted; file system becomes
      read-only.
    * Hash function may be suboptimal. XXX
